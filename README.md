This is a Django-based recipe project where you can add, delete, update, and search for recipes. In this project,<br> I implemented features to fetch data from the database and display it on the frontend website. <br>I also applied<br> various backend concepts and logic, ensuring a seamless integration between <br>the frontend and backend. <br>The project showcases<br> my ability to manage data efficiently, <br>handle user interactions, and build a fully functional web application with Django.
