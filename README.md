This is a Django-based recipe project where you can add, delete, update, and search for recipes. In this project, I implemented features to fetch data from the database and display it on the frontend website. <br>I also applied various backend concepts and logic, ensuring a seamless integration between the frontend and backend. <br>The project showcases my ability to manage data efficiently, handle user interactions, and build a fully functional web application with Django.
